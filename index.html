        <pre class="texts"><h2> Basic Game Rules</h2>
            You are the batsman! You need to score as many runs as possible while avoiding all the fielders!
            There will be eleven fielders against you, placed randomly all over the grid. 
            The number of runs you score will be written on the block once you click it. 
            One block can get you either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6 runs. These runs will add up to your total score!
            Once you select a block with a fielder, the game will end.</pre>
